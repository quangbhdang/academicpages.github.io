## Hi, my name is Dang or Quang Ba Hai Dang ðŸ˜Š.

I am a postgraduate in Artificial Intelligence with experience in the Advertising and Marketing industry. I am passionate about technology, computer science, and data in general.

My journey to become a data scientist is slightly unusual as my original background was in business. In my first ever job, I was often surrounded by data daily, yet many times I found decisions were made arbitrarily without understanding the existing data. The problem was that we were surrounded by data but lacked insights. Spending time organizing and preparing data was considered "geeky" and often overlooked in favor of more creative tasks.

However, I don't believe this is the case, and there is a way to marry creativity and data-driven decision-making to create truly valuable solutions for everyone involved. Thus, my journey of self-learning to program and process data began. Before I knew it, I ended up spending a lot of time preparing data, building automated pipelines, and extracting insights from them, as well as experimenting with building simple models (i.e., data engineering without proper training). At this point, Artificial Intelligence started to gain public attention, and I saw the huge potential in Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Generative Models in augmenting the way we interact with data.

I wanted to better understand what is behind Artificial Intelligence and when it should be employed, and how other Deep Learning or even Traditional Machine Learning techniques can help address problems.

Thus, I decided to return to university for my master's degree in AI. I created this page to record mainly three things:
- My research notes and understanding of AI research.
- Helpful tips and guides during my learning journey.
- My personal takes on the current human-AI fields.

Hopefully, this will be helpful to those who are on a similar journey like me or simply to those who are curious about what it's like to be in this industry.
